# ðŸ“±Financial Assistant

This is web-platform that consists of a knowledge base with a gathered and preprocessed banking data and a digital assistant capable of answering user queries in real-time.

Client side â€” SPA with MVC architecture. State management is implemented using an Observer pattern. Axios library is used to make requests to server.

Assistant is a question-answering system with a "Hybrid Retriever" architecture. Assistant's hybrid approach combines _BM25 Okapi_ algorithm for a keyword-based search ("Sparse retriever") and _Multilingual E5 embedding model_ for a semantic search ("Dense retriever"). Final results are sorted by _Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)_ to choose the most relevant text from the knowledge base.
